        <h1>San Francisco: the best and the worst</h1> 
        
        <h2> The best neighborhood is the Tenderloin</h2>
        
        <p>I love fily alleys, sketchy people and unsuspecting <strong>European victims</strong></p>
        
        <h2> The worst neighborhood is the Mission</h2>
        
        <p>I hate <em>pretentious artists</em>, local tourists and people with too much money.</p>
